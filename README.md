## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Yay! My own public scratchpad, hosted by Microsoft!

### Where is my code?

A few years ago, I tried to consolidate most of my code, which was spread across different platforms (Sourceforge, Darcshub, Bitbucket, Github), in one place: The vast majority of my projects are on [**my Fossil server**](https://code.rosaelefanten.org), some of them were also mirrored on Github.

However, since Github has decided [not to care much](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/09/github_copilot_lawsuit/) about such trifles as licence terms and copyrights, I have decided not to be an unpaid data cow for greedy big corporations. I'll keep a small number of repositories available here for your convenience. All other projects will only be available on my server or - some smaller ones - [on Darcshub](https://hub.darcs.net/dertuxmalwieder) and I encourage you to do the same.

#### Update, 08/2025

Note that I am in the process of (slowly) migrating my Github mirrors [to Codeberg.](https://codeberg.org/dertuxmalwieder)

### How can you reach me?

My preferred method of contact is e-mail, but I can also be reached by various other means. You can find a sufficiently up-to-date list and my PGP key [on keyoxide.org](https://keyoxide.org/tux0r@rosaelefanten.org).
