## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Yay! My own public scratchpad, hosted by Microsoft!

### My code

A few years ago, I tried to consolidate most of my code, which was spread across different platforms (Sourceforge, Darcshub, Bitbucket, Github), in one place: The vast majority of my projects are on [**my Fossil server**](https://code.rosaelefanten.org), some of them were also mirrored on Github.

However, since Github has decided [not to care much](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/09/github_copilot_lawsuit/) about such trifles as licence terms and copyrights, I have decided not to be an unpaid data cow for greedy big corporations. The last of my projects that remain on Github are [`yaydl`](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/yaydl), my YouTube-and-more downloader, [groffstudio](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/groffstudio), my GNU troff IDE, [SublimeTodoTxt](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/SublimeTodoTxt), a Sublime Text package for Todo.txt support, and [`libvldmail`](https://github.com/dertuxmalwieder/libvldmail), my library for RFC-compliant validation of email addresses. All other projects will only be available on my server and I encourage you to do the same.
